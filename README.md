Win 1: I think that my CSS is a win. Being the first project working with it, I think it looks nice.
Win 2: I wanted to choose a CYOA that had elements that I was familar with but push myself to do it individually and I think I acheived that.
Win 3: The delete functionality was initially being buggy and it is completely functional now.
